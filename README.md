# resume_scanner
This is a resume scanner tool.
The program opens and reads a .txt file.
The program then uses a loop to scan for and print keywords.
Finally the program closes the file.
This program is not finished as I plan to add pdf, csv, and json functionality.
I also plan to add user input functions to allow users to add a file from the terminal.

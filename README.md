# resume_scanner
This is a resume scanner tool.
The program uses the PyPDF2 library to convert pdf files to txt files.
The program then opens and reads the newly converted txt file.
Following this, it uses a loop to scan for and print keywords.
Finally the program closes the file.
I also plan to add user input functions to allow users to add a file from the terminal.
